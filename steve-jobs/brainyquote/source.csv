"Throughout my years in business, I discovered something. I would always ask why you do things. The answers that I would invariably get are: 'Oh, that's just the way things are done around here.' Nobody knows why they do what they do. Nobody thinks very deeply about things in business.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The desktop computer industry is dead. Innovation has virtually ceased. Microsoft dominates with very little innovation. That's over. Apple lost. The desktop market has entered the dark ages, and it's going to be in the dark ages for the next 10 years, or certainly for the rest of this decade.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn't be ours anymore.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
You'll see more and more perfection of that - computer as servant. But the next thing is going to be computer as a guide or agent.,https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"There's no other company that could make a MacBook Air and the reason is that not only do we control the hardware, but we control the operating system. And it is the intimate interaction between the operating system and the hardware that allows us to do that. There is no intimate interaction between Windows and a Dell notebook.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"We think Android is very, very fragmented, and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple strives for the integrated model so that the user isn't forced to be the systems integrator.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
Woz is living his own life now. He hasn't been around Apple for about five years. But what he did will go down in history.,https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"It is piracy, not overt online music stores, which is our main competitor.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"I think right now it's a battle for the mindshare of developers and for the mindshare of customers, and right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"This revolution, the information revoultion, is a revolution of free energy as well, but of another kind: free intellectual energy. It's very crude today, yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt bulb to run it and it can save you hours a day. What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now, or 50 years from now?",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"We're going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I'm not downplaying that.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes

The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network. We're just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone.,https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn't build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren't going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"Now, we are selling over 5 million songs a day now. Isn't that unbelievable? That's 58 songs every second of every minute of every hour of every day.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"We've demonstrated a strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket, we don't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions. And so I think that we'd like to continue to keep our powder dry, because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
Each year has been so robust with problems and successes and learning experiences and human experienes that a year is a lifetime at Apple. So this has been ten lifetimes.,https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"It took us three years to build the NeXT computer. If we'd given customers what they said they wanted, we'd have built a computer they'd have been happy with a year after we spoke to them - not something they'd want now.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"It takes these very simple-minded instructions - 'Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it's greater than this other number' - but executes them at a rate of, let's say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"I'll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I'll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry. There may be a few years when I'm not there, but I'll always come back.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car. You don't have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don't have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The reason we wouldn't make a seven-inch tablet isn't because we don't want to hit a price point, it's because we don't think you can make a great tablet with a seven-inch screen.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"It's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money. I can tell you, though: If they don't really want to build a company, they won't luck into it. That's because it's so hard that if you don't have a passion, you'll give up.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The seven-inch tablets are tweeners: too big to compete with a smartphone, and too small to compete with an iPad.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we've chosen to do with our life.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The engineering is long gone in most PC companies. In the consumer electronics companies, they don't understand the software parts of it. And so you really can't make the products that you can make at Apple anywhere else right now. Apple's the only company that has everything under one roof.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"I met Woz when I was 13, at a friend's garage. He was about 18. He was, like, the first person I met who knew more electronics than I did at that point. We became good friends, because we shared an interest in computers and we had a sense of humor. We pulled all kinds of pranks together.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it's easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We're supposed to be really good at this. That doesn't mean we don't listen to customers, but it's hard for them to tell you what they want when they've never seen anything remotely like it.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
I'm very excited about having the Internet in my den.,https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"I think it's brought the world a lot closer together, and will continue to do that. There are downsides to everything; there are unintended consequences to everything. The most corrosive piece of technology that I've ever seen is called television - but then, again, television, at its best, is magnificent.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what iPhone is. OK? So, we're going to reinvent the phone.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The manual for WordStar, the most popular word-processing program, is 400 pages thick. To write a novel, you have to read a novel - one that reads like a mystery to most people. They're not going to learn slash q-z any more than they're going to learn Morse code. That is what Macintosh is all about.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes

"But Apple really beats to a different drummer. I used to say that Apple should be the Sony of this business, but in reality, I think Apple should be the Apple of this business.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it's humorous, all the attention to it, because it's hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that's happened to me.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"The desktop metaphor was invented because one, you were a stand-alone device, and two, you had to manage your own storage. That's a very big thing in a desktop world. And that may go away. You may not have to manage your own storage. You may not store much before too long.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"First was the mouse. The second was the click wheel. And now, we're going to bring multi-touch to the market. And each of these revolutionary interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product - the Mac, the iPod and now the iPhone.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"Well, Apple invented the PC as we know it, and then it invented the graphical user interface as we know it eight years later (with the introduction of the Mac). But then, the company had a decade in which it took a nap.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
"Pointing is a metaphor we all know. We've done a lot of studies and tests on that, and it's much faster to do all kinds of functions, such as cutting and pasting, with a mouse, so it's not only easier to use but more efficient.",https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/steve-jobs-quotes
