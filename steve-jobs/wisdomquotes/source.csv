"People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you’re doing and it’s totally true. And the reason is because it’s so hard that if you don’t, any rational person would give up.

"If you really look at the ones that ended up, you know, being “successful” in the eyes of society and the ones that didn’t, oftentimes, it’s the ones who were successful and loved what they did so they could persevere, you know, when it got really tough. And the ones that didn’t love it quit because they’re sane, right? Who would want to put up with this stuff if you don’t love it?",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"That was one of the things that came out most clearly from this whole experience [with cancer]. I realized that I love my life. I really do. I’ve got the greatest family in the world, and I’ve got my work. And that’s pretty much all I do. I don’t socialize much or go to conferences. I love my family, and I love running Apple, and I love Pixar. And I get to do that. I’m very lucky.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"You get your wind back, remember the finish line, and keep going.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"At Apple, people are putting in 18-hour days.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance. It is so hard. You put so much of your life into this thing. There are such rough moments in time that I think most people give up. I don’t blame them. It’s really tough and it consumes your life.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"If you’ve got a family and you’re in the early days of a company, I can’t imagine how one could do it. I’m sure it’s been done but it’s rough. It’s pretty much an eighteen hour day job, seven days a week for awhile. Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you’re not going to survive. You’re going to give it up.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"You’ve got to have an idea, or a problem or a wrong that you want to right that you’re passionate about, otherwise you’re not going to have the perseverance to stick it through. I think that’s half the battle right there.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I’ve read something that Bill Gates said about six months ago. He said, ‘I worked really, really hard in my 20s.’ And I know what he means because I worked really, really hard in my 20s too. Literally, you know, 7 days a week, a lot of hours every day. And it actually is a wonderful thing to do, because you can get a lot done. But you can’t do it forever, and you don’t want to do it forever, and you have to come up with ways of figuring out what the most important things are and working with other people even more.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"On the MacIntosh: When we finally presented it at the shareholders’ meeting, everyone in the auditorium gave it a five-minute ovation.

"On the MacIntosh: It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn’t be ours anymore.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
My wife deserves all the credit for keeping me at it.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"On his father: He was a machinist by trade and worked very hard and was kind of a genius with his hands. He had a workbench out in his garage where, when I was about five or six, he sectioned off a little piece of it and said “Steve, this is your workbench now.” And he gave me some of his smaller tools and showed me how to use a hammer and saw and how to build things. It really was very good for me. He spent a lot of time with me… teaching me how to build things, how to take things apart, put things back together.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I can tell you this: I’ve been married for 8 years, and that’s had a really good influence on me. I’ve been very lucky, through random happenstance I just happened to sit next to this wonderful woman who became my wife. And it was a big deal. We have 3 kids, and it’s been a big deal. You see the world differently.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I’ve never been so tired in my life. I’d come home at about ten o’clock at night and flop straight into bed, then haul myself out at six the next morning and take a shower and go to work. My wife deserves all the credit for keeping me at it. She supported me and kept the family together with a husband in absentia.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Most people don’t get those experiences because they never ask. I’ve never found anybody that didn’t want to help me if I asked them for help.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"As you may know, I was basically fired from Apple when I was 30 and was invited to come back 12 years later so that was difficult when it happened but maybe the best thing that could ever happen to me.

"We’ve done so many hardware products where Jony and I have looked at each other and said, ‘We don’t know how to make it any better than this, we just don’t know how to make it’.

"When I was 12 or 13, I wanted to build something and I needed some parts, so I picked up the phone and called Bill Hewlett – he was listed in the Palo Alto phone book. He answered the phone and he was real nice. He chatted with me for, like, 20 minutes. He didn’t know me at all, but he ended up giving me some parts and he got me a job that summer working at Hewlett-Packard on the line, assembling frequency counters. Assembling may be too strong. I was putting in screws. It didn’t matter; I was in heaven.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"Ever since I’ve had cancer, I’ve been thinking about it more. And I find myself believing a bit more. I kind of – maybe it’s ’cause I want to believe in an afterlife. That when you die, it doesn’t just all disappear. The wisdom you’ve accumulated. Somehow it lives on, but sometimes I think it’s just like an on-off switch. Click and you’re gone. And that’s why I don’t like putting on-off switches on Apple devices.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"I have been trained to think in units of time that are measured in several years. With what I’ve chosen to do with my life, you know, even a small thing takes a few years.

The upshot is that the place feels more like a young company.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
But it’s a disservice to constantly put things in this radical new light – that it’s going to change everything. Things don’t have to change the world to be important.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"One of the keys to Apple is Apple’s an incredibly collaborative company. You know how many committees we have at Apple? Zero. We have no committees. We are organized like a start-up. One person’s in charge of iPhone OS software, one person’s in charge of Mac hardware, one person’s in charge of iPhone hardware engineering, another person’s in charge of worldwide marketing, another person’s in charge of operations.

"We have wonderful arguments.

[…] A lot of times, when you have to walk a thousand miles and you take the first step, it looks like a long way, and it really helps if there’s someone there saying, “Well we’re one step closer. The goal definitely exists; it’s not just a mirage out there”.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"The hard part of what we’re up against now is that people ask you about specifics and you can’t tell them. A hundred years ago, if somebody had asked Alexander Graham Bell, ‘What are you going to be able to do with a telephone?’ he wouldn’t have been able to tell him the ways the telephone would affect the world.

"Even a great brand needs investment and caring if it’s going to retain its relevance and vitality and the Apple brand has clearly suffered from neglect in this area in the last few years, and we need to bring it back.

"The best example of all and one of the greatest jobs of marketing that the universe has ever seen, is Nike. Remember, Nike sells a commodity. They sell shoes.

"None of the really bright people I knew in college went into politics.

And that keeps the B players, the bozos, from larding the organization, only the A players survive.

And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I don’t think that most of the really best people that I’ve worked with worked with computers for the sake of working with computers. They worked with computers because they are the medium that is best capable of transmitting some feeling that you have, that you want to share with other people.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"What I do see is a small group of people who are artists and care more about their art than they do about almost anything else. It’s more important than finding a girlfriend, it’s more important… than cooking a meal, it’s more important than joining the Marines, it’s more important than whatever.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Look at the way artists work. They’re not typically the most ‘balanced’ people in the world. Now, yes, we have a few workaholics here who are trying to escape other things, of course. But the majority of people out here have made very conscious decisions; they really have.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"One of my role models is Bob Dylan. As I grew up, I learned the lyrics to all his songs and watched him never stand still. If you look at the artists, if they get really good, it always occurs to them at some point that they can do this one thing for the rest of their lives, and they can be really successful to the outside world but not really be successful to themselves. That’s the moment that an artist really decides who he or she is. If they keep on risking failure, they’re still artists.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"It’s rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing. Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they’re rare.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"As you are growing and changing, the more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you that it thinks you are, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times, artists have to go, “Bye. I have to go. I’m going crazy and I’m getting out of here.” And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"You’ve baked a really lovely cake, but then you’ve used dog shit for frosting.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it’s inside the box. A great carpenter isn’t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody’s going to see it.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it’s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don’t take the time to do that.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Many companies forget what it means to make great products. After initial success, sales and marketing people take over and the product people eventually make their way out.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn’t cost much. It was the original vision for Apple. That’s what we tried to do with the first Mac. That’s what we did with the iPod.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"We will make them bright and pure and honest about being high-tech, rather than a heavy industrial look of black, black, black, black, like Sony.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"We spent some time in our family talking about what’s the trade-off we want to make. We ended up talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family. Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half? Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer? Did we care about using a quarter of the water?",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
We spent two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table. We’d get around to that old washer-dryer discussion. And the talk was about design.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"People think it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"You’re asking, where does aesthetic judgment come from? With many things: high-performance automobiles, for example, the aesthetic comes right from the function, and I suppose electronics is no different.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I’ve also found that the best companies pay attention to aesthetics. They take the extra time to lay out grids and proportion things appropriately, and it seems to pay off for them. I mean, beyond the functional benefits, the aesthetic communicates something about how they think of themselves, their sense of discipline in engineering, how they run their company, stuff like that.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain, these concepts and fitting them all together in kind of continuing to push to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
I have always found Buddhism – Japanese Zen Buddhism in particular – to be aesthetically sublime. The most sublime thing I’ve ever seen are the gardens around Kyoto.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Look at the Mercedes design, the proportion of sharp detail to flowing lines. Over the years, they have made the design softer but the details starker. That’s what we have to do with the Macintosh.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
What we’re trying to do is remove the barrier of having to learn how to use a computer.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
This is what customers pay us for – to sweat all these details so it’s easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We’re supposed to be really good at this. That doesn’t mean we don’t listen to customers.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"It’s hard for them to tell you what they want when they’ve never seen anything remotely like it. Take desktop video editing. I never got one request from someone who wanted to edit movies on his computer. Yet now that people see it, they say, ‘Oh my God, that’s great!’.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"What we’re going to do is make the products high-tech, and we’re going to package them cleanly so that you know they’re high-tech. We will fit them in a small package, and then we can make them beautiful and white, just like Braun does with its electronics.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"On making simple designs: It’s insane: We all have busy lives, we have jobs, we have interests, and some of us have children. Everyone’s lives are just getting busier, not less busy, in this busy society. You just don’t have time to learn this stuff, and everything’s getting more complicated… We both don’t have a lot of time to learn how to use a washing machine or a phone.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Our DNA is as a consumer company – for that individual customer who’s voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That’s who we think about.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
We think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"Besides Dylan, I was interested in Eastern mysticism, which hit the shores at about the same time.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Woz and I very much liked Bob Dylan’s poetry, and we spent a lot of time thinking about a lot of that stuff.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I started to listen to music a whole lot and I started to read more outside of just science and technology, Shakespeare, Plato. I loved ‘King Lear’.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Apple is about something more than that, Apple, at the core, its core value, is that we believe that people with passion can change the world for the better.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Learning to program teaches you how to think. Computer science is a liberal art.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Picasso had a saying: good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas, and I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
On why he made everybody sign the Mac cases: Because the people that worked on it consider themselves and I certainly consider them artists. These are the people that under different circumstances would be painters and poets but because of that time that we live in this new medium has appeared in which to express oneself to one’s fellow species and that’s a medium of computing.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
How do you know the direction to head with products? It boils down to taste. Emerge yourself with the best ideas from the humanities. And integrate them. Pull interests from diverse areas.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
A lot of people that would have been artists and scientists have gone into this field to express their feeling and so it seemed like the right thing to do.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
The finest dozen computer scientists I know are all musicians.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

Leonardo da Vinci was a great artist and a great scientist.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Michelangelo knew a tremendous amount about how to cut stone at the quarry.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"The finest dozen computer scientists I know are all musicians. Some are better than others, but they all consider that an important part of their life. I don’t believe that the best people in any of these fields see themselves as one branch of a forked tree. I just don’t see that. People bring these things together a lot.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Anyway, one of our biggest challenges, and the one I think John Sculley and I should be judged on in five to ten years, is making Apple an incredibly great 10 or 20 billion-dollar company. ‘Will it still have the spirit it does today?’ We’re charting new territory.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"If Apple becomes a place where computers are a commodity item, where the romance is done, and where people forget that computers are the most incredible invention that man has ever invented, I’ll feel I have lost Apple. But if I’m a million miles away, and all those people still feel those things… then I will feel that my genes are still there.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"You know, Dr. Edwin Land was a troublemaker. He dropped out of Harvard and founded Polaroid.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"On Dr. Edwin Land: Not only was he one of the great inventors of our time but, more important, he saw the intersection of art and science and business and built an organization to reflect that.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"You need a very product-oriented culture, even in a technology company. Lots of companies have tons of great engineers and smart people. But ultimately, there needs to be some gravitational force that pulls it all together. Otherwise, you can get great pieces of technology all floating around the universe. But it doesn’t add up to much.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"We did iTunes because we all love music. We made what we thought was the best jukebox in iTunes. Then we all wanted to carry our whole music libraries around with us. The team worked really hard. And the reason that they worked so hard is because we all wanted one. You know? I mean, the first few hundred customers were us.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"What are we, anyway? Most of what we think we are is just a collection of likes and dislikes, habits, patterns. At the core of what we are is our values, and what decisions and actions we make reflect those values.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Well, I was thrown out of school a few times.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Invest time in yourself to have great experiences that are going to enrich you.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"The key thing to remember about me is that I’m still a student. I’m still in boot camp. If anyone is reading any of my thoughts, I’d keep that in mind.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country… I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating. None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"We wanted to more richly experience why were we were alive, not just make a better life, and so people went in search of things. The great thing that came from that time was to realize that there was definitely more to life than the materialism of the late 50’s and early sixties. We were going in search of something deeper.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Between my sophomore and junior years, I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative-writing classes.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
You could get LSD fresh made from Stanford. You could sleep on the beach at night with your girlfriend. California has a sense of experimentation and a sense of openness – openness to new possibilities.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Human minds settle into fixed ways of looking at the world and that’s always been true and it’s probably always going to be true.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"I’m completely stunned. I’m 19 years old, in a foreign country, up in the Himalayas, and here is this bizarre Indian baba who has just dragged me away from the rest of the crowd, shaving my head atop this mountain peak. I’m still not sure why he did it.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I bought an apartment in New York, but it’s because I love that city. I’m trying to educate myself, being from a small town in California, not having grown up with the sophistication and culture of a large city. I consider it part of my education.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
The most important thing is a person. A person who incites and feeds your curiosity; and machines cannot do that in the same way that people can.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"One of the saints in my life is this woman named Imogene Hill, who was a fourth-grade teacher who taught this advanced class. She got hip to my whole situation in about a month and kindled a passion in me for learning things. I learned more that year than I think I learned in any year in school.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I was pretty bored in school, and I turned into a little terror. You should have seen us in third grade. We basically destroyed our teacher. We would let snakes loose in the classroom and explode bombs.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
School was pretty hard for me at the beginning.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"My mother taught me how to read before I got to school and so when I got there I really just wanted to do two things. I wanted to read books because I loved reading books and I wanted to go outside and chase butterflies. You know, do the things that five-year-olds like to do. I encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever encountered before, and I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They came close to really beating any curiosity out of me.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Obviously, one of the great challenges of an education is to teach us how to think. What we’re finding is that computers are actually going to affect the quality of thinking as more and more of our children have these tools available to them.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"When you’re young, a little bit of course correction goes a long way. I think it takes pretty talented people to do that.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things – that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Focusing is about saying no.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
Just get rid of the crappy stuff and focus on the good stuff.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"We try to focus and do very few things well. And focusing is hard because focusing doesn’t mean saying yes, it means saying no. So we decide not to do a lot of things so we can focus on a handful of things and do them well.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
I have a very simple life. I have my family and I have Apple and Pixar. And I don’t do much else.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
My favorite things in life don’t cost any money.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Well, my favorite things in life are books, sushi and… My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time. As it is, I pay a price by not having much of a personal life. I don’t have the time to pursue love affairs or to tour small towns in Italy and sit in cafés and eat tomato-and-mozzarella salad.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"I end up not buying a lot of things, because I find them ridiculous.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

Look at the design of a lot of consumer products – they’re really complicated surfaces. We tried to make something much more holistic and simple.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don’t put in the time or energy to get there.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
We believe that customers are smart and want objects which are well thought through.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"What I found when I got here was a zillion and one products. It was amazing. And I started to ask people, now why would I recommend a 3400 over a 4400? When should somebody jump up to a 6500, but not a 7300? And after three weeks, I couldn’t figure this out. If I couldn’t figure this out… how could our customers figure this out?",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"Apple is a $30 billion company, yet we’ve got less than 30 major products. I don’t know if that’s ever been done before. Certainly the great consumer electronics companies of the past had thousands of products. We tend to focus much more.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
"We’re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it’s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste.,https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"Their products have no spirit of enlightenment about them, they are very pedestrian. The sad part is that customers don’t have a lot of that spirit either, but the way that we’re going to ratchet up our species is to take the best and to spread it around everybody so that everybody grows up with better things and starts to understand the subtlety of these better things.",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/

"Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus’ success in the spreadsheet – basically, the applications business.

"There’s lots of ways to be as a person. And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands, you never hear their story or tell yours, but somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are, and remember what’s really important to us. Steve Jobs",https://wisdomquotes.com/steve-jobs-quotes/
