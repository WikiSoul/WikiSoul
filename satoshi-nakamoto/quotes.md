The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks.
I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.
Most of the value comes from the value that others place in it. Gold, for instance, is pretty, non-corrosive and easily malleable, but most of its value is clearly not from that. Brass is shiny and similar in color. The vast majority of gold sits unused in vaults, owned by governments that could care less about its prettiness.
If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry.
